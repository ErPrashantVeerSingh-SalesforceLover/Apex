                                                              SOQL
	Salesforce object query language
    1. developer console
    2. workbench
    3. data loader	
	
	
	
1. Basic structure of SOQL:
   Object: Account
   Id
   Query:
   select Id from Account
   select Id, Active__c from Account     // always use field name or API
   
  Note: another way/method to open object from developer console: Ctrl+ Shift+O
  
2. Where clause:
   select Id, Active__c from Account Where Active__c ='Yes'
   select Id, Active__c,TickerSymbol from Account Where TickerSymbol='EDGE\'s'      //when you have the value in field like Ram's pen; EDGE's com
   
   Note: where clause can't exceed more than 4000
         Total characters in SOQL query can be 20,000
		 
3.  Null operator: both string as well number
                 a. Active__c is picklist (text/string value)
	select Id, Active__c from Account where Active__c =NULL     // to get records with blank value field
	select Id, Active__c from Account where Active__c !=NULL    // to get record with some value in the field
	
	             
                b. Phone_Number__c is number data type
    select Id, Phone_Number__c from Account Where Phone_Number__c=Null            // will fetch all account with field Phone_Number__c having no values 
	select Id, Phone_Number__c from Account Where Phone_Number__c!=Null           // will fetch all account with field Phone_Number__c having some values
	
4. Boolean field: to identify boolean values we use True and False
                  Check box field
    
   SELECT Id, Hot_Account__c FROM Account where Hot_Account__c =TRUE             // fetch all accounts with Hot_Account__c is checked
   SELECT Id, Hot_Account__c FROM Account where Hot_Account__c =False            // fetch all accounts with Hot_Account__c is unchecked
   
5. Operators:
   =     equal           
   !     not
   !=    not equal
